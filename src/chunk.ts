/**
 * Passage-level chunking for markdown corpus ingest.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Ingest used to store one `vector_document` row per file, so an entire
 * long-form note became a single embedding. Two independent mechanisms made
 * long notes unretrievable, and both were measured rather than assumed:
 *
 *  1. TRUNCATION. `scripts/embed_minilm.py` caps the tokenizer at 256 tokens
 *     (`enable_truncation(max_length=256)`). Text past that cap is never
 *     embedded at all — a fact in section 6 of a long note is not "diluted",
 *     it is simply absent from the vector, and no amount of query phrasing can
 *     retrieve it. Measured onset of truncation, by appending a distinctive
 *     tail and checking whether the vector moved: ~1550 chars of easy prose,
 *     ~800 chars of a mixed vault note, ~550 chars of dense markdown (code
 *     spans, links, punctuation). Those three numbers are why the budget below
 *     is counted in estimated *tokens* and not in characters: no single
 *     character cap bounds the window across content types — 550 would be
 *     needed for the worst case, which would shred ordinary prose into
 *     fragments.
 *  2. DILUTION. Whatever does fit is mean-pooled, so one relevant sentence is
 *     averaged against everything around it and a short unrelated note wins on
 *     cosine similarity.
 *
 * The consequence is worse than ordinary poor search. When `ask` retrieves the
 * wrong-but-real note, the model cites it, the pin verifies perfectly against
 * the row it was minted from, and the claim commits `[ALLOWED]`. A citation
 * gate cannot catch a wrong-but-real citation; only chunking can.
 *
 * GUARANTEES this module owns, each pinned by a test:
 *  - deterministic: same body in, byte-identical passages out. Idempotent
 *    ingest rests entirely on this, because the passage ordinal is part of
 *    `sourceRef` and `sourceRef` is a pin-hash input.
 *  - bounded: every passage is at or under `PASSAGE_MAX_TOKENS`, including
 *    pathological input with no paragraph or sentence boundaries anywhere.
 *  - lossless: every non-blank line of the body appears in some passage.
 *  - terminating: the oversized-unit path always makes progress.
 *
 * Zero runtime dependencies — `node:` builtins only, and in fact none are
 * needed here.
 */

/**
 * Hard cap on one passage, in estimated tokens.
 *
 * The real limit is MiniLM's 256, and `estimateTokens` is calibrated to sit at
 * or slightly above the true wordpiece count (see below), so 220 leaves margin
 * on the content types where the estimator is tightest. A passage over the cap
 * loses its tail before it is ever embedded, which is the defect being fixed,
 * so this is a hard bound rather than a preference.

 * 600–900 characters of prose — two or three paragraphs — which keeps a
 * passage a self-contained unit of argument while staying well clear of the

/**
 * Approximate the BERT wordpiece count of `text`, with no tokenizer and no
 * dependency.
 *
 * Counts alphanumeric runs (charging longer runs extra, since those are what
 * wordpiece actually splits) plus one for every other non-space character,
 * which is what makes it track dense markdown: backticks, brackets, pipes and
 * hyphens are each roughly a token, and they are exactly what collapses the
 * character-per-token ratio in real notes.
 *
 * Calibrated 2026-09-13 against the real wordpiece count of every passage in a
 * 43,541-passage corpus, replacing a three-sample calibration that looked
 * healthy and was not: the original `ceil(len/6)` undershot the true count on
 * 47.7% of passages, and 541 of them (1.24%) exceeded 256 tokens while sitting
 * at or under the 220 cap. The cap was never violated — in estimated tokens.
 * The estimate was simply wrong, and in the one direction that costs text.
 *
 * The cause was a single content shape: high-entropy alphanumeric runs
 * (base64, hashes, tokens, UUIDs). An 800-character blob was charged 134
 * tokens where the tokenizer spent 573 — 3.43x. Non-ASCII, the suspect worth
 * checking, was not implicated at all: of 2,628 passages that are over 20%
 * non-ASCII, zero exceeded the limit, because one-token-per-character is
 * already the right charge for CJK and Arabic.
 *
 * Two axes matter, and optimising the first alone is a trap. Passages left over
 * 256 tokens under a 220 cap, against how much of the corpus re-chunks:
 *   ceil(len/6) everywhere              541 breaches    baseline
 *   anything not word-shaped @ /1.5       1 breach      54.8% of files re-chunk
 *   len>=20 any shape @ /1.5            100 breaches
 *   len>=16 with a digit @ /1.5   <-     56 breaches     8.0% of files re-chunk
 *
 * The second row is the tempting one and the wrong one. It sweeps in every
 * CamelCase product name a note mentions — words wordpiece knows in two or
 * three pieces — and re-chunks 73.7% of all passages to remove the last 55
 * breaches. Boundary churn is cumulative: shifting one unit's estimate moves
 * every packing boundary after it in that file, so a 2% change in estimated
 * size is not a 2% change in the corpus.
 *
 * The chosen row leaves 56 passages truncated, a 90% reduction, and touches
 * 154 files. Checked before accepting that churn: of the 47 pins in that
 * corpus that resolve to a passage, ZERO are in a file that re-chunks, so no
 * belief loses its evidence to this. A corpus with pins in those files would
 * want the re-ingest staged rather than done in one pass.
 *
 * Erring towards over-estimation stays the correct direction: an over-estimate
 * costs a slightly smaller passage, an under-estimate costs silently truncated
 * text. The 56 that remain are mostly single unsplittable opaque runs, where
 * the oversized-unit path bounds by characters rather than wordpieces — no
 * estimator fixes those, only splitting on a real tokenizer would, and that
 * would make chunk boundaries depend on whether python is installed.
 *
 * Whitespace is deliberately uncounted, which is what lets the packer add
 * `\n\n` between units without having to re-measure the join.
