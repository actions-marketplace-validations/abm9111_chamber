 *
 * The framing is JSON.stringify of a fixed 3-element array, NOT

 * does not by itself make this function injective: title and source_ref are
 * nullable columns, and `row.title ?? ""` — coalescing NULL to "" *before*
 * building the array — collapsed exactly the distinction JSON.stringify was
 * introduced to preserve, because the coalescing ran before the array existed
 * rather than inside it. `JSON.stringify([null, body, ref])` and
 * `JSON.stringify(["", body, ref])` are different strings; `?? ""` made sure
 * the formula never produced the first one, so a title or source_ref that
 * flipped between SQL NULL and "" between ingests hashed identically — the
 * same undetectable-drift failure the array framing above exists to close,
 * reopened one line later. The values below are therefore passed through,
 * not defaulted: NULL stays `null` and "" stays `""`. The one default that
 * remains, `?? null`, is not a coalesce-to-placeholder — it normalizes
 * `undefined` to `null`, because inside a JSON array a bare `undefined`
 * element also serializes to `null`, and leaving that implicit would make the
 * formula correct only by the accident that SQLite always yields `null` and

/**
 * The moved-within-file rescue, for the report path only.
 *
 * Measured before it existed (vault backtest, 2026-08-18): one insertion at
 * the top of a note re-slotted every passage below it, and all nine pins on
 * that note fired hash_mismatch while their bodies sat byte-identical one
 * position down. The mechanism is structural, not bad luck: `source_ref`
 * (`path#pN`) participates in the snapshot formula, so a moved passage's
 * stored hash differs from its pin's, and the by-snapshot-hash relocation in
 * verifyPin searches for a hash that embeds the position the passage left —
 * it can rescue a row that lost its *id* (ref unchanged), never one that lost
 * its *position*.
 *
 * So this rescue searches the other way around: take each row still in the
 * pinned file, re-frame its stored [title, body] at the pin's recorded
 * position, and compare through vaultPageHash — the one formula, not a copy.
 * Equality proves the candidate's title and body are byte-identical to what
 * was pinned, with exactly the strength of the primary check; content that
 * merely resembles the pinned passage cannot pass, so this cannot decay into
 * a similarity judgement.
 *
 * Same file only, by construction: the SQL range scan bounds candidates to
 * `path#…` (`'#'` sorts immediately below `'$'`), and because vault filenames
 * legitimately contain `#` (the same reason ingest.ts refuses LIKE for this
 * scan — `%` and `_` are wildcards there), a range hit is confirmed with a
 * passagePathOf equality check before hashing. Byte-identical text in a
 * *different* file stays an alarm: the file is part of what a citation
 * claims, and the backtest measured file-level accuracy at 100% — that is
 * the property being preserved.
 *
 * Bounds of the rescue, stated rather than implied:
 *  - The gate never takes it: only drift reporting passes allowRelocation,
 *    for the reasons on VerifyPinOptions.
 *  - A pin whose row is *gone* (not_found) cannot take it: vdoc ids are
 *    opaque hashes, so with the row deleted there is no recorded position to
 *    re-frame against. A note that shrank past a moved passage therefore
 *    still reports not_found.
 *  - A bare ref (`chamber index` rows, no `#pN`) has no position to have
 *    moved from; skipped.
 *  - A file holding the same passage twice resolves deterministically
 *    (ORDER BY id, like the primary relocation) — and if the pinned instance
 *    was edited while a byte-identical twin survived elsewhere in the file,
 *    the twin rescues the pin and lost support reads as a move.
 *
 *    This is NOT inherited from relocation-by-content generally, and an
 *    earlier version of this comment claimed it was. The primary relocation
 *    matches on `snapshot_hash`, which contains `source_ref` — so it can only
 *    match a row whose title, body AND position are all byte-identical, i.e.
 *    proof that nothing moved. Re-framing deliberately breaks that coupling:
 *    it asks whether some other position's content equals what was pinned,
 *    which is exactly what lets it follow a shifted passage, and exactly what
 *    makes it unable to distinguish "the same paragraph, moved" from "a
 *    different paragraph that reads identically." Content-addressing cannot
 *    separate those without an identity signal this schema does not store
 *    (see KNOWN_LIMITATIONS 6: `source_ref` on `belief_source`). Callers must
 *    therefore not render a relocation as proof the citation is unchanged —
 *    it is proof the pinned text still exists in that file.

 * vouches for. Until tombstones land, verify can at least *say* it.
 *
 * The check is the filesystem, not an ingest manifest, which dissolves the
 * excluded-vs-gone ambiguity that makes the deletion version of this feature
 * dangerous: an excluded file still exists on disk and is correctly not
 * reported; a gone file is gone regardless of why the walk skipped it. Only
 * rows written by `chamber ingest` participate — they carry `ingestRoot` in
 * metadata and a `path#pN` ref; rows from `chamber index` have no on-disk
 * location to check and are skipped, which under-reports rather than
 * false-alarms.
 *
 * Read-only, and deliberately not part of verify's exit code: pins on stored
 * content DO verify, and flipping the exit here would change the scheduled
 * job's contract before tombstones give the operator a way to act.
