 * runs back-to-back during module evaluation, every async test would be
 * mid-flight and interleaving with every other one before any of them
 * settle. Several tests in this suite mutate shared `process.env` keys,
 * so concurrent interleaving produces flaky, order-dependent failures.
 *
 * Nothing pushed here has run yet. The summary block at the bottom of
 * this file drains this queue sequentially — one thunk invoked and

 * reads `N/N passed · 0 failed`, exit 0. A reviewer simulated a full

 *   already printed, and its failure never reaches the exit code.

//  1. Truncation. The MiniLM tokenizer is capped at 256 tokens
//     (scripts/embed_minilm.py). Everything past that cap is never embedded at
//     all — a fact in section 6 of a long note is not "diluted", it is absent
//     from the vector. Measured truncation onset: ~1550 chars of easy prose,
//     ~800 chars of a mixed vault note, ~550 chars of dense markdown. A
//     char-based size cap therefore cannot bound the window across content
//     types, which is why the budget below is counted in estimated tokens.
//  2. Dilution. Whatever does fit is mean-pooled, so one relevant sentence in
//     a long note is averaged against everything around it, and a short
//     unrelated note wins on cosine similarity.
//
// The consequence is worse than poor search. When `ask` retrieves the
// wrong-but-real note, the model cites it, the pin verifies perfectly against
// the row it was minted from, and the claim commits [ALLOWED]. A citation gate
// cannot catch a wrong-but-real citation — only chunking can.

// this machine, so if the guard ever stopped working that import would open a
// real long-poll against Telegram and this suite would hang rather than fail.
//
// Nothing held the positive direction, and its failure mode is the quiet one.
// If `invokedDirectly()` returns false for the real entry point — a refactor
// that moves this file, a bundler that rewrites argv[1], a switch to
// `import.meta.main` on a Node that reports it `undefined` — then
// `npm run gateway` exits 0 having done absolutely nothing, and a suite that
// only checks the negative stays green while the runner is dead.
//
// So: launch it as a subprocess, never import it, with every messenger token
// removed from the environment. Scrubbing the token is what keeps this test
// off the network — with one present, `main()` reaches TelegramGateway.start()
// and long-polls until the timeout kills it. With none, `main()` falls into
// its console-gateway branch, prints, and returns. That branch is the whole
// assertion: those two lines exist nowhere but inside `main()`, so seeing them
// proves `main()` ran, and the process terminating proves it was reached the
// way an operator reaches it rather than by hanging somewhere earlier.
//
// CHAMBER_CONFIG names a file that does not exist and CHAMBER_DB is the
// in-memory sentinel, so no real `~/.config/chamber/` is read and no real
// database is touched. This branch opens no database at all; both are belt and
// braces against a future `main()` that resolves one before dispatching.

/*
 * src/secret_box.ts — OAuth tokens at rest.
 *
 * Three defects, all live before this block existed:
 *
 *  1. `sealSecret` stored plaintext unless *both* NODE_ENV=production and
 *     CHAMBER_REQUIRE_TOKEN_KEY=1. deploy/Dockerfile set only the first and no
 *     shipped artifact set the second, so both supported deployments wrote
 *     access and refresh tokens in the clear, prefixed `plain:`.
 *  2. No length was checked before slicing. `Buffer.subarray` clamps rather
 *     than throwing, so a truncated row produced a *short* GCM tag, which Node
 *     accepts (4, 8, 12-16 bytes are all legal). Weakening the forgery bound is
 *     within reach of anyone who can truncate stored ciphertext. semgrep:
 *     javascript.node-crypto.security.gcm-no-tag-length.
 *  3. A passphrase became a key through one unsalted SHA-256 — one hash per
 *     guess, and a rainbow table shared with every other user of that phrase.
 *
 * The fix for (3) had to be versioned rather than applied in place: changing
 * the derivation would have made every stored token undecryptable. So the
 * first test here is the compatibility one.
