/**
 * Strip YAML frontmatter, returning the title (if any) and the body.
 *
 * This is not a YAML parser (zero runtime dependencies — a real parser is
 * out of scope). It handles:
 *  - a `title:` value that itself contains a colon, quoted or not — the
 *    capture group runs to end-of-line, so only the `title:` prefix is
 *    special, not colons inside the value;
 *  - a file that is *only* frontmatter — `body` comes back `""` and the
 *    caller's existing empty-body guard skips it, rather than this function
 *    inventing placeholder content;
 *  - CRLF line endings, via the `\r?` in both the body-strip regex and
 *    regex `.`/`$` line-terminator semantics for the title line;
 *  - a document that never had frontmatter at all (does not start with
 *    `---`) — returned untouched, including any `---` horizontal rules
 *    appearing later in its body.
 *
 * One case beyond the above is guarded deliberately: a document that
 * *opens* with a `---` horizontal rule that is NOT frontmatter (just a
 * stylistic top-of-document divider) followed eventually by another `---`
 * used as an ordinary section break. Naively taking "the next `---`" as the
 * close would treat everything between the two as frontmatter and silently
 * drop it from the body — real content loss with no error. Real
 * frontmatter's first line is always `key: value`; a document opening with
 * a horizontal rule instead of frontmatter essentially never is. So the
 * fenced region is only accepted as frontmatter if it *opens* with a line
 * that looks like `key:`; otherwise the whole raw text is returned as body,
 * exactly as if there had been no leading `---` at all.
 *
 * "Opens with" means the FIRST line inside the fence, not the first
 * non-blank one. That distinction is the whole guard: real YAML
 * frontmatter never begins with a blank line, whereas a stylistic divider
 * is almost always followed by one. Skipping blanks let
 * `---\n\nNote: as discussed…` — an ordinary paragraph whose first line
 * happens to end in a colon (`Note:`, `TODO:`, `Source:`) — read as
 * key-shaped, so the opening paragraph was consumed as frontmatter and
 * silently dropped. Taking the first line verbatim makes that input fall
 * through to the untouched-body path while every real frontmatter block
 * (`title:` first, `tags:` first, CRLF, frontmatter-only) still parses.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT handled (would need real YAML, not a heuristic): prose
 * placed immediately after the opening `---` with no blank line and whose
 * first line looks like `key:` still misparses as frontmatter — on that
 * exact shape a heuristic cannot tell prose from a YAML key. Frontmatter
 * fields other than `title` (lists, nested maps, multi-line block scalars)
 * are not parsed at all; only `title` is ever extracted.
